# Prints the tag that the currently checked out commit should be released as,
# or nothing at all if it does not warrant a release.
#
# Usage: bin/compute-next-tag.sh
#
# Tags look like `v<YOURLS version>-<release>`, which is what this repository has
# always published (v1.9.2-0 ... v1.10.4-1):
#
# - if defaults/main.yml points at a YOURLS version that has never been released,
#   the release counter restarts at 0 (`v1.10.5-0`)
# - otherwise the counter is incremented (`v1.10.5-1`), but only if something that
#   actually affects the role has changed since the last release
#
# Determining the version from defaults/main.yml, rather than from the commit
# message of the pull request that got merged, makes the result independent of the
# order in which pull requests get merged, and lets any change to the role (bugfix,
# feature, dependency bump) release itself without a human tagging. The
# commit-message approach this replaced read the version out of Renovate's subject
# line, so a commit landing any other way - a fix pushed from a phone, a rebase
# that reworded the subject - was never released at all.
